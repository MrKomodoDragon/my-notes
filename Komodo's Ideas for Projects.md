### [KMake](KMake)
This is a build system I want to make, simply for fun and learning how they work.
I want this to be a replacement for Make and other build system

### [Coreutils](Coreutils)
Sometime in the future, I would like to do a rewrite/remake of the [GNU CoreUtils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html) in Rust. Why? I don't know. Partially because it is old and written in C, but I also wanna know how these work. What better way than to write them yourself? :^)
